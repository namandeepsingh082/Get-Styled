# E-Commerce Platform

Welcome to our E-Commerce Platform project! This comprehensive platform leverages modern technologies to provide users with an intuitive and secure online shopping experience.

## Introduction

Our E-Commerce Platform integrates React for the frontend, Strapi as the headless CMS for the backend, and Stripe for secure payment processing. The project emphasizes a user-centric design, responsive interfaces, and efficient API integration to offer a seamless shopping journey.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **client**: Contains the frontend developed with React and SCSS.
- **api**: Houses the backend built with Strapi.
